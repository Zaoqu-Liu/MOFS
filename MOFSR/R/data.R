#' Functional Gene Sets
#' @description
#' The gene_sets data object contains a unified collection of gene sets derived from multiple sources, including curated pathways (c2.cp.v2022.1.Hs), Gene Ontology terms (c5.go.v2022.1.Hs), and hallmark gene sets (h.all.v2022.1.Hs). These gene sets are based on version 2022.1 and represent key biological processes, pathways, and well-defined biological states. By integrating these sources, the gene_sets object provides a comprehensive dataset that can be utilized for enrichment analysis and functional exploration, offering valuable insights into underlying biological mechanisms.
