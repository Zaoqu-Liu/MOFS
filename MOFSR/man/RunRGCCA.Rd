\arguments{
\item{data}{A list of matrices where each element represents a different modality (e.g., RNA, protein, methylation). Each matrix should have rows as features and columns as samples.}

\item{N.clust}{Integer. Number of clusters to create from the hierarchical clustering of the RGCCA components (optional but recommended).}

\item{connection.matrix}{Matrix. Connection matrix specifying the relationships between blocks (default: 1 - diagonal matrix of block length).}

\item{num.components}{Integer vector. Number of components to compute for each block (default: 1 component per block).}

\item{scheme}{Character. The RGCCA scheme to use, can be one of "centroid", "factorial", or "horst" (default: "centroid").}

\item{regularization}{Character or numeric vector. Regularization parameter for each block, can be "optimal" or a numeric value (default: "optimal").}

\item{scale}{Logical. Whether to scale each block to zero mean and unit variance (default: TRUE).}

\item{initialization}{Character. Initialization method for the RGCCA algorithm, either "svd" or "random" (default: "svd").}

\item{bias}{Logical. Whether to use biased or unbiased estimator of the variance/covariance (default: TRUE).}

\item{tolerance}{Numeric. Convergence tolerance (default: 1e-08).}

\item{verbose}{Logical. Whether to show progress messages (default: FALSE).}

\item{clustering.algorithm}{Character. The clustering algorithm to use for hierarchical clustering (default: "ward.D2").}

\item{max.iterations}{Integer. Maximum number of iterations for the RGCCA algorithm (default: 1000).}
}
\value{
A data frame with the following columns:
  - Sample: The sample identifier.
  - Cluster: The assigned cluster number for each sample.
  - Cluster2: The assigned cluster label, prefixed by 'RGCCA' to indicate that the clustering was performed using RGCCA.

\description{
This function performs clustering analysis using Regularized Generalized Canonical Correlation Analysis (RGCCA), which integrates multiple data modalities (e.g., RNA, protein, methylation) to provide a unified clustering result. RGCCA helps in capturing shared information between multiple data types and provides insights into the relationships between different modalities.
}
\details{
This function uses RGCCA to integrate multiple data matrices and then performs hierarchical clustering on the resulting components to identify clusters. RGCCA is particularly useful for identifying shared structures across multiple modalities, providing a comprehensive view of the relationships between different data types.

The function operates as follows:
1. Each matrix in the input list is transposed so that rows represent samples and columns represent features.
2. RGCCA is performed to extract components that summarize the shared variation across different modalities.
3. Hierarchical clustering is applied to the concatenated components to assign each sample to a cluster.
4. The function returns a data frame containing the cluster assignment for each sample, along with additional information about the clustering process.

# Example usage:
data1 <- matrix(rnorm(10000), nrow = 100, ncol = 100)
data2 <- matrix(rnorm(10000), nrow = 100, ncol = 100)
colnames(data1) <- colnames(data2) <- paste0("Sample", 1:100)
data_list <- list(data1, data2)

# Run RGCCA clustering
result <- RunRGCCA(data = data.list, N.clust = 3)
