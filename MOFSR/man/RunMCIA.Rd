\title{Run Multiple Co-Inertia Analysis (MCIA) for Multi-Modality Data Integration}
\usage{
RunMCIA(
  data = NULL,
  N.clust = NULL,
  n.components = 10,
  clustering.algorithm = "ward.D2",
  scan.eigenvalues = FALSE,
  use.nsc = TRUE,
  use.svd = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A list of matrices where each element represents a different modality (e.g., RNA, protein, methylation). Each matrix should have rows as features and columns as samples.}

\item{N.clust}{Integer. Number of clusters to create from the hierarchical clustering of the MCIA components (optional but recommended).}

\item{n.components}{Integer. Number of components to retain for each modality (default: 10).}

\item{clustering.algorithm}{Character. The clustering algorithm to use for hierarchical clustering (default: "ward.D2").}

\item{scan.eigenvalues}{Logical. Whether to show the co-inertia analysis eigenvalue plot to help select the number of axes (default: FALSE).}

\item{use.nsc}{Logical. Whether to perform multiple non-symmetric correspondence analyses. Recommended to keep TRUE (default: TRUE).}

\item{use.svd}{Logical. Whether to use singular value decomposition to perform the analysis (default: TRUE).}
}
\value{
A data frame with the following columns:
  - Sample: The sample identifier.
  - Cluster: The assigned cluster number for each sample.
  - Cluster2: The assigned cluster label, prefixed by 'MCIA' to indicate that the clustering was performed using MCIA.

\description{
This function performs clustering analysis using Multiple Co-Inertia Analysis (MCIA) to integrate multiple omics datasets. MCIA helps capture shared variation across different data modalities and provides insights into the common structures of the data.
}
\details{
This function uses MCIA to integrate multiple data matrices and then performs hierarchical clustering on the resulting components to identify clusters. MCIA is useful for identifying shared structures across multiple data modalities.

The function operates as follows:
1. Each matrix in the input list is transposed so that rows represent samples and columns represent features.
2. MCIA is performed using the omicade4 package to extract components that summarize the shared variation across different modalities.
3. Hierarchical clustering is applied to the concatenated components to assign each sample to a cluster.
4. The function returns a data frame containing the cluster assignment for each sample, along with additional information about the clustering process.

# Example usage:
data1 <- matrix(rnorm(10000), nrow = 100, ncol = 100)
data2 <- matrix(rnorm(10000), nrow = 100, ncol = 100)
colnames(data1) <- colnames(data2) <- paste0("Sample", 1:100)
data_list <- list(data1, data2)

# Run MCIA clustering
result <- RunMCIA(data = data_list, N.clust = 3)
